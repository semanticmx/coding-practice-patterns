# Merge Two Strings

Given two words, word1 and word2 return the merged string

word1:  [a|b|c|d|e|]
word2:  [a|b|c|d|e|f|g|h|i|j|k|l|m|n]
merged: [a|a|b|b|c|c|d|d|e|e]
        [a|a|b|b|c|c|d|d|e|e|f|g|h|i|j|k|l|m|n]

## Challenges

1. Loop over two strings
2. Find the shortest or the longest
3. Concatenate the longest string tail
4. Slice a string

## Edge Cases

- Empty strings
- word1 has 1 character
- word1 and word2 have the same characters
- Exceeds character limits

## Approach

1. zip()
2. For-loop
3. ternary operator (if)
4. list slicing
5. concatenate strings
6. convert a list to string using join()

## Optimized approach

## Take Away
